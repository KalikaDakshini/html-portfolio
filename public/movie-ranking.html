<h1>Favourite Anime List</h1>

<h2>My top 3 anime of all time that I hold very dear to my heart</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Revolutionary Girl Utena</h3>
<p>
	Anime I describe as "Lesbians fighting against the heteropatriarchy" is a show
	that uses magical realism and sword duels in a high school graduation setting
	to present a scathing critique of patriarchy and what one needs to do to
	liberate from the shackles it puts on us
</p>

<h3>Dungeon Meshi</h3>
<p>
	Anime about how an autistic man and a lesbian woman save the world from the
	horrors of taboo and our desires towards it. With a charming and diverse
	character cast, constant twists and turns in a story with dense worldbuilding,
	it keeps you surprising and has you thinking with every new episode
</p>

<h3>Chainsaw Man</h3>
<p>
	I can't describe this, not that it is undescribable, I just haven't given it
	enough thought. It's shonen Utena to put it simply and the author has the
	heart of a lesbian.
</p>

<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>
	I love the grim realistic imagery and the environmental vs human exploitation
	messaging. It is a very unsettling movie in all the good ways
</p>
